        If you already have a JSON example for this resource, Pericles can
        try to pre-fill the attributes from it. The JSON must
        directly contain the resource: it must not contain a root key
        and must not be an array. Nested resources are found using key names.
        With a key "user" or "users" Pericles will look for a User resource.
